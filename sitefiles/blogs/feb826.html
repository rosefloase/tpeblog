<p><w>hi!!! hi hi hello!!!!!
<br>as i am writing this, i'm currently in the final stages of creating my NEW BLOG PAGE.
</w></p>

<div class="center">
    <img class="bigpic" src="/resc/img/blog/indev.png">
</div>

<p><w>this revamp of my blog was created during the tpe <a href=https://thepersonever.net/revamp target="_blank">revamp</a>, so that my blog could have better searchability (both on site and on external aggregators) and maintainability!
<br>my <a href="https://thepersonever.net/blogg" target="_blank">old blog page</a> was just one static page, with an iframe in the center meant for navigating between posts. there was no way to search the contents of posts, no way to send links to specific blog posts, and the tiny iframe was way too cramped for in-depth reading. the design of the page was also very distracting... but i mean that's kinda just how most of my pages are :p
<br>later on in the page's life, i added support for sharing links... but it was so. so damn hacky
</w></p>

{% highlight js %}
let params = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
			
// if the ?post= param is longer than the max characters that can be in a properly named blog document, don't do anything with the param
// (meant to keep people from just linking any page on the internet into the iframe)
if (params.get("post") && params.get("post").length < 8){ 
	document.getElementById("blog").src = "/iframes/blogblogs/"+params.get("post"); 
}
			
// change the iframe's src if a ?post= param is present on page init
function blogchange(windowloc){
	if (windowloc != "/iframes/bblawhgg.html" && windowloc != "/iframes/bblawhgg"){		
		changeurl(windowloc.replace("/iframes/blogblogs/", ""));
	}
	else{
	var stateObj = { foo: "bar" };
	history.pushState(stateObj, "page 2", "blogg");
	}
}

// changes the url of the main page to be a share-ready link when a post is opened in the iframe
function changeurl(get){
	var stateObj = { foo: "bar" };
	history.pushState(stateObj, "page 2", "blogg?post=" + get);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p><w> with this new site, i'll be able to write blog posts that cover more than just personal topics! i'm obviously still planning to write site and personal update posts, but i'll also be able to cover topics like linux howtos and how i make art :D
<br>this site also reflects how i'm going to build sites from now on: by building on palemoon, THEN testing on more modern browsers. this should help with the technical debt acquired by targeting modern browsers first, then backporting to older rendering engines
</w></p>

<p><w>overall, i'm really proud of how this page came out!!! you can all expect more in-depth blog posts soon :D
</w></p>
