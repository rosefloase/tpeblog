  <h2><w> dreamcast? mroe like uh um funcast uh</w></h2>
  <h2><w> dec 31,, 2022
  <br> 11:30 pm</w></h2>
<p><w> what a year.. what a heckin year
<br> well,, im stuck at my grandma's so i cant really celebrate so
<br> why not be "productive" while i have nothing else to do !!!!1!!!!
<br>
<br>..
<br> i uh
<br>i have nothing else to talk about so im gonna talk about my experiences with the dreamcast (wow! experiencing something 12 months after you got it thats so super cool)
<br>
<br> uh.. sonic adventure is really fun !!
<br> so fun that uh.. ive a-ranked every level in sonic's campain up until sky deck which im working on..
<br> also skiping casinopolis because i dont want to spend 18 minutes in total on that.. thing :(
<br>..
<br> ive actually beaten the game,, too.. all on a crt
<br> ive actually never beaten it before last time because i got stuck on big's story when i uh. got the steam port when i was like 11
<br>..
<br> ive also been working on chao rasing.. because im insane and crazy and bonkers and STUPID
<br>
<br> soul calabur is Fine Enough when your just going for all the unlockables,, and Fun when your playing with uh idk your dad
<br>
<br> crazy taxi is a neat enough arcade port,, might help me with route planning the next time i go to the black hills.. as if thats gonna happen again :P
<br>.. also i could probebly just use the gba ver. for route planning,, but the dc version is better for at-home use i guess
<br>
<br> and the dreamcast web browser is Neat but i cant really use it.. maybe if i set up dreamcast live someday ill like.. see if i can work on my site from my dreamcast lolll
<br>.. it might not support js though.. so i might not be able to use the web editor :P
</w></p>

<p><w> heayah!!
<br>..i guess ill talk about some stuff about how im making this site
<br> more specifically,, the parts you dont see.. or cant see..
<br>..im still working on this in school,, where everyone is loud and annoying anid its painful to think and goodLORD WHY IS EVERYONE SHOUTING
<br>
<br>..i do most of my coding in school,, where we have to use chromebooks.. so i like. use the neocitites web editor.. 
<br>..sometimes the school likes to do this Thing where they block the editor so i just. work on stuff that can be copied and pasted in a gdoc.. like basically all of these blog posts..
<br>
<br> i usually make webpages because im like “wow!!!! i wanna show off this thing and then i spend like 50 hours making that thing and perfecting that thing..
<br>
<br>..ok time to do some science stuff in math because i dont wanna fail scienceeee 
<br> uh. yeah

<br> yesterday,, i set up all my av consoles onto my old crt

<br> its because its the only 4:3 tv i have..
<br> so uh.. like pikmin 2 looks.. fine,, with black boarders
<br> stretched out it looks stretched out (ew!) and with 16:9 patches it still doesnt look the greatest..
<br> but on a 4:3.. it really looks like you can see everything..!!
<br> i know thats like.. stupid sounding,, considering you can see the most with 16:9 patches on a 16:9 display,, but just.. it looks better than you’d expect
<br> also we love katamari sounds funny on a mono tv :P

<br>
<br> ...
<br>
<br> ok,, i think i found something..

<br> like i always thought it was like something that you just. HAD to use the preset thing but no!! you can just make your own like its a normal webpage
<br> so.. i did just that
<br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/f1zJK0S.jpg height=300px>
<br>
<br> and its also like!! really quick to get into stuff!!! and just as customizable as any other html thing!!!!!!!! can you tell how much i love this site haha
