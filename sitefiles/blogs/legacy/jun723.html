<p><w>uh!!! hello
<br>i TOLD myself i would continue updating my site even past the end of school, and, well,
<br>you can see how well that turned out.
<br>i made another twitter account so ive been spending most of my time there??? it really just makes me anxious but. its the only way i know how to communicate with people so >_>
<br>uh. in terms of more creative-y stuff
<br>ive started using flstudio instead of lmms!! its a lot better at copy and paste stuff and is SO better when using samples but. soundfonts dont sound as good as they should sometimes :(
<br>ive also started drawing for an mspfa that a friend wrote! it doesnt look that good and it doesnt have an actual title yet but. yk ^_^
<br>ive also been working on a Really Bad animation for lawnmower. but. i started it in flash without realizing the avi encoding is broken for flash 10 :( so unless you wanna download a swf file... and flash player 10...
<br>
<br>im probably not gonna host the mspfa on thepersonever even once it gets a name, since its not just some silly thing im doing by myself... but ill almost definitely put a thing at home saying "hey look at this i worked on this!!!" once its ready to be. viewed.
<br>
<br>im sorry this blog post is so short :(
