	<p><w>and by rices, i of course mean linux rices
	<br>i drew this <a href="https://xenia-linux-site.glitch.me/" target=_blank>xenia</a> to use as my launcher/start menu icon! :D i'm posting a clean picture of it here, as i really like how it turned out</w></p>

	<p><w>back when i got my current computer, i tried installing manjaro on it to daily drive! because scalarknight TRICKED me into believing flash and fl studio would work well. they don't.
	<br>i kinda doubt wine will ever be as comparable to windows when it comes to running windows applications... so umm qt version of flash pro when ^_^</w></p>

	<p><w>recently, i've been exposed to more and more rices due to being more active on the web in general! sooooooo...
	<br>i thought this to myself a lot: <i>what if i made kde pretty...?</i></w></p>

    <p title="this a lie sorry"><w>well. apparently, if you think enough about something it spontaneously happens! at least that's what i assume i don't know how this got riced</w></p>

    <p><w>back when i installed manjaro, i chose the kde desktop environment! so, that's what this system is using... for now. quite a few of the programs i use are from kde's default suite, so this isn't a "real rice" so to say... but who cares i had fun doing this!! :p</w>
    <br><small><w>sorry for all you WM lovers out there but i am toooo lazy to switch off of kde now and try to recreate all of this work RIGHT FUCKING NOW. maybe later though</w></small></p>

    <p><w>the main thing i really customized was my taskbar. i used <a href="https://github.com/luisbocanegra/plasma-panel-colorizer" target=_blank>panel colorizer</a> to change its theming! it has a lot of nice options for customization, and a few built-in themes :O if you're on kde, i'd recommend checking it out
    <br>my current launcher/start menu is the built-in "kicker" thing. though it's nice and compact, i'll probably look into alternatives later... since there doesn't seem to be a lot of customization options</w></p>

    <p><w>for more misc. stuff:
    <br>- i use <a href="https://store.kde.org/p/1002715" target=_blank>kdust aurorae</a> for my window decorations
    <br>- <a href="https://store.kde.org/p/1379986" target=_blank>nova7</a> for my icons
    <br>- and DMZ as my cursor! (you can find it in the kde store, or um. find it yourself if you're smarter than i)</w></p>

	<p><w>that's it i think! also merry deltamas</w></p>
