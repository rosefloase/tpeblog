<p><w>it's a 4th gen monochrome! i've been trying to resurrect it since i found it, but that started out with me just. buying a brand new hdd for the thing.
<br>obviously the other hdd died in it, so a few months ago, i finally bit the bullet and just bought an iflash board. unfortunately, the sd card i got for $20 to use with the thing didn't work!</w></p>
<p><w>like on the website it was listed to not fucking work!</w></p>

<p><w>so obvioulsy, i resold the sd card at my local used videogame store and got 6 dollars back
<br>what did i use those six dollars for? getting Sega GT 2002, of course!</w></p>
