<h2><w>
<br>march 28th, 2025</w></h2>

<p><w>i broke my ipod again but that's a blog for a later date</w></p>

<p><w>a little while ago, i created a page for my thoughts</w></p>

<p><img src=/resc/img/legacy/jadethoughts.png class=bigpic></p>

<p><w>i'm not linking it here for reasons but if you're curious about this page poke around my about me
<br>i created this page to replace how i used twitter, as twitter really messes with my head</w></p>

<p><w>whenever posting on my private account (or even my main account but to a lesser extent), i get really anxious if nobody likes or replies to it
<br>my brain interprets no interaction as people not caring</w></p>

<p><w>however, when posting here, i don't have that issue!
<br>i can't worry about people not interacting with my post because they don't care - i know that people won't see it because they don't know i posted
<br>i can't worry about posting something stupid, because i'm not competing with people to create interesting content here</w></p>

<p><w>despite the fact that less people will look at these posts, i feel more seen here</w></p>
<p><w>probably because i'm not comparing what attention i get to what other people are getting</w></p>
