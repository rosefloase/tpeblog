<p><w>oh hey it works!! i can play it through to completion!! nice :D</w></p>
<p><w>let's plug it into S&K now, and</w></p>

<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/N4nG1sC.jpeg class=smallpic></p>

<p><w>where are my saves</w></p>
<p><br></p>

<p><w>after some testing, i have concluded that sonic and knuckles does NOT transfer saves from sonic 3!! :(
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PYrPm6B.jpeg class=smallpic></p>
<p><w>i made a new save in sonic 3 alone, where there WASN'T a save slot in S&K, and it's just. not there in 3&K</w></p>

<p><w>sonic 3 & knuckles is still a good game though! i got it on the genesis just now, due to being on a sonic kick again. this isn't my first experience with sonic 3 though...
<br>i originally played sonic 3 on the gamecube's mega collection! i couldn't get past angel island, though. i also didn't actually own this game... i just borrowed it from someone
<br>a while after i played MC on gamecube,, i got mega collection plus for my ps2!</w></p>

<p><w>after abandoning s3 on mega collection <i>again</i>, i got to carnival night in sonic classic collection on my ds!! i sold that game for sonic rush, though...
<br>i also lost sonic rush. still have the box, though!</w></p>

<p><w>the first time i actually BEAT sonic 3 was with sonic 3 air, on my shitbox minipc</w></p>

<p><w>unfortunately, i got rid of windows.old when i reinstalled windows on this thing... now my old S3A save AND a bunch of <i>old</i> unreleased songs are lost to time... <a href=https://downloads.thepersonever.net/xdx3xp/lmms/statingparenthasis.wav target=_blank>colon stating parenthesis</a>, your lmmp will never see the light of day... :( </w></p>

<p><w>anyways, back on track! sonic 3!</w></p>

<br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CeQ9VnS.jpeg class=smallpic></p>

<p><w>this game,</w></p>

<br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CeQ9VnS.jpeg class=smallpic></p>

<p><w>titled sonic the hedgehog 3,</w></p>

<br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CeQ9VnS.jpeg class=smallpic></p>

<p><w>is the best classic sonic game released in the 1990's</w></p>

<p><w>i'm not usually the best critic of... anything really, due to wanting people to experience art blind, but i mean. you can play this on a windows xp pc (which i have done as well! i did not get past carnival night there either!) so go grab a rom from the internet archive of sonic 3 (AND KNUCKLES. MAKE SURE & KNUCKLES IS THERE) and play it with <a href=http://www.gens.me/ target=_blank>gens</a> or something :p</w></p>

<p><w>oh right i also had this</w></p>

<p><w>awesome</w></p>

<p><w>my favorite zones from S3&K are ice cap and flying battery, primarily due to their music. each of the 4 zones' themes blend the atmosphere of their zones with frantic speed, resulting in tracks that fit both the environment you're speeding through, and the speed that you're traveling at! :D</w></p>

<p><w>when completing sonic 3 by itself, i nabbed all the chaos emeralds and beat the game with super sonic. i... kinda expected a different ending compared to what was in the final game. like, something more bombastic maybe? more than just a single different sprite? whatever. i'm just glad 3&K made up for it! ^_^</w></p>

<p><w>that's about it for this post. up next: finishing actual 3&K on my genesis!</w></p>
