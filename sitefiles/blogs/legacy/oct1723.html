<p><w>do you ever just think of possible lyrics to a song that could be gut-wrenching if given the right context
<br>no? yeah me neither then :D
<br>i ordered something off of amazon at the beginning of this month, but its going to get here at the end of the month...
<br>im going to switch from focusing on getting a better gpu to. getting more comfortable clothes. then im gonna try to focus on getting a better cpu, because the one currently in my pc isnt that good
<br>like... minecraft chugs trying to load more than 8 chunks. and its not very easy to explore because it hangs every time it loads a new chunk 
<br>not sure if thats my hardwares fault though? most source games run alright, and gmod usually hits above 200fps on the x64 branch... though i know thats not really a hard thing to accomplish anymore :P mgh
<br>maybe it has something to do with the shaders im using??? i feel like those would be more dependent on the gpu, but i havent really tested that...
<br>sildur's shaders medium hits around 50 fps when exploring already generated chunks, and ss high usually hits around 35 fps :p 
<br>haha yes i have optifine! thanks for checking though :)
<br>uh! during the first week of october, i worked on a virtual room tour. it was mainly made to work on my javascript skills, but you can check it out <a href=https://thepersonever.net/room/ target=_parent>here!</a> 
<br>other than that, ive been kinda taking a break due lack of ideas and... other personal reasons :(

<br>ive been working on pikmin 3's page in jellyfloat pool, but thats not really finished yet. i need to add original backgrounds for all areas other than the garden of hope, and i need to finish writing for twilight river to the formidable oak
