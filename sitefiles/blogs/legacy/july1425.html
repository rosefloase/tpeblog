title: "a month of linux..."

<center>
	<p><w>hey! so! it's been a month!
	</w></p>

	<img src=https://i.imgur.com/nanoC06.png class="bigpic">

	<p><w>i have succumbed to the i3 mind virus. AND I'M COMING FOR YOU NEXT!!!!!!!!!!!
	</w></p>

	<p><w>i've spent the last month running linux as my main pc os, and it's been fun! i've been learning a lot about how linux works under the hood, and many apps (and even games!) are preforming better than i expected :D
	<br>you may notice that i'm not on manjaro anymore! that is because manjaro made like any other linux distro i've used, and decided to crap out and show me nothing but a black screen. that was really fun
	<br>so i did what any sane person would do, and move to a distro that lets you have more control over what is and isn't installed on your computer! <a href=https://archlinux.org target=_blank>arch!</a>
	</w></p>

	<p><w>arch's design is based around only installing the packages you need. need a drawing tablet driver? desktop environment? base firefox? gui wifi manager? nano? <i><b>no???</b> then you don't have to install it!! ^_^</i>
	<br>this is really good for my usecase, as i don't have to worry <i>as much</i> about system stability. if i install something fucky, i'll most likely know what's messing up my system! then, i can just remove it with the live install dvd :D it truly is oh so very shrimple
	<br>i prefer this a lot to the "oh just reinstall your os" tactic i've used since i got my first pc that i could really mess with, as i get to keep my data that's on my boot hard drive!
	<br>while arch's install is something you have to do via the cli (and the wizard that it comes with is really fucky), the arch wiki has a very easy to follow <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide target=_blank>install guide</a> that will help people who don't know anything about the commands they're pumping into their pc :o i'd say part of the reason my venture to linux has been so successful is because i'm learning about how to configure my system, instead of just installing shit and hoping it works
	</w></p>
	<p><w>speaking of configuration...
	<br>when i first got arch up and running functionally on my pc, the first thing i did was install kde!
	</w></p>

	<img src=https://i.imgur.com/esssAdb.png class="bigpic">

	<p><w>it ran pretty damn well, too. i was able to make it pretty quickly with the knowledge i had gained with my manjaro rice, and i had fun messing around with some of the software included with the full kde suite for a bit!
	<br> However!
	</w></p>
	<h3><w><i>wine was the death of me once again!</i></w></h3>

	<p><w>like. like are you. are. are you seeing this shit
	</w></p>

	<p><w>this pissed me off so bad i ended up switching to i3
	<br>looking back, i'd guess now that this is more of an xwayland thing than a kde-specific thing. i may be a little stupid
	<br>however, it's too late for me to change back to kde! navigating windows with vim bindings is actually insane and i love it
	<br>i use <a href=https://github.com/RedBeesRGD/i3-gradients target=_blank>i3-gradients</a>, which is a fork of i3! i chose it because i thought it would support vertical gradients... but it doesn't yet :(
	</w></p>

	<p><w>i really like i3 because it allows for keyboard window navigation, in-depth configuration, and because it's generally quick and responsive! i use <a href=https://github.com/polybar/polybar target=_blank>polybar</a> for my status bar, as the default i3 one is. ugly
	</w></p>

	<p><w>anyways, that's pretty much it! see you next year
	</w></p>
