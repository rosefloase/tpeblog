<p><w>oh that's neocities's (neocities'?) founder supporting ai.
<br>no thanks!
<br>
<br>okay. so last night i moved TPE over to nekoweb... and it! seems like it will be cool :D
<br>the webmasters seem to hate ai as much as literally everyone else, supporter here is only 3$ a month (albeit with 40 less gigs for site storage), the nekoweb editor just looks like notepad++ (sans spellcheck), and they apparently have their own static site generator stuff with nodejs!
<br>one problem though
<br>nekoweb is blocked on my school's wifi too :(

 <p><w>this just means i can't experement with any nekoweb-specific features while i'm bored in school, such as the static site generator stuff. my plans of slowly developing a nekowebVM web adventure reader have been thwarted!!! as WELL as my plans of messing around on the homepage dancing around with my custom cursor D:
<br>
<br>still, messing around with nekoweb seems like an interesting prospect!! it's always fun messing around with a new hosting provider :D

 <p><w>
   i need to get around to making more of this site mobile-friendly. see you in a year
