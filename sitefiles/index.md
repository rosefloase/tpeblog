<w>hey, fuck ur CULTURE.
<br>i ain't got no CULTURE.</w>

	<p><w>oh</w></p>

	<p><w>uh. okay
	<br>i guess i have. a lot to talk about! so talk i must i guess</w></p>

	<p><w>first up, i should address the title of this blogpost. i've been able to take a break from school, which has let me recover my artistic abilities :D
	<br>prepare to see even more updates to both this site and psfla... sooooon!</w></p>

	<p><w>aside from that, um. i've been working on a different roblox game while trying to not die from doing too much at once!</w></p>
	<img src="images/robloxhouse.png" width="700">
	<p><w>it's pretty much complete... just gotta get the game page assets done, and it'll be ready to release! :D</w></p>

	<p><w>i've also been playing a few games recently... namely the jak and daxter trilogy (FUCK JAK 2), crash 3, and crash team racing!</w></p> 
	<img src="images/KILLJAK2.apng" width="500">
	<p><w>i got the jak and daxter trilogy on ps3 to show sony i still care about the ps3 store okay. don't shut it down sony. pretty please?
	<br>jak 1 and 3 are okay enough, but. i really don't like jak 2. it's trying way wayyy too hard to be gta... 80% of its runtime is driving... instead of fixing the combat the first game had it just gives jak a gun... and daxter TALKS LESS. and this game has to be soooo serious all of the damn time!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	<br>at least jak 3 is more fun and varied than jak 2. fuck jak 2 all my homies hate jak 2</w></p>
	<p><w>ctr and crash 3 are both good games, but i feel like everyone reading this knows why already. so, i'll save you a few hours by not going over them :p</w></p>
	<p><w>oh also! i got a new phone!</w></p>

	<p><w>it's a razr 2023 :D i got it due to the fact that it has a front screen that isn't literally just another phone screen... i wanted a phone that had a little screen on the top that could show notifications, and not much more
	<br>the folding aspect of this phone has unfortunately proven to not really keep me from using it as often... BUT! i'm free from apple's closed source wasteland :D
	<br>i can't unlock the bootloader to my phone... but i CAN sideload apps without an unreasonable amount of hassle!!!! this means i can use open source alternatives to most of google's suite, as well as use basic as fuck apps on my phone that aren't filled with ads</w></p>
	<p><w>i've also gotten back into the hell that is the battle cats. did you know they made a 3ds port? i've been dreaming about that since i was 6
	<br>maybe i'll write a blog post about the 3ds version when i finish it...</w></p>

	<p><w>anyways, that's pretty much it for this post! i'll see you all very soon :D</w></p>
