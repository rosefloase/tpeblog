<p><w>hey guys! so i just
<br>wait how long has it been 
</w></p>

<p><img src=/resc/img/legacy/uhoh2.png class="smallpic"></p>
<p><img src=/resc/img/legacy/TWOWEEKS.png class="smallpic"></p>

<comic>two weeks...</comic>
<p><w>damn. okay.
<br>sorry about that :( i've been busy with stuff though!!!
<br>like. uh. making pages for <a href="https://psfla.net/" target=_blank>psfla!!</a>
</w></p>

<p><a href="https://psfla.net/a/13337/?pg=47" target=_blank><img src=/resc/img/legacy/00047.png width=500px></a></p>

<p><w>this flash took more than a day to make... mainly because i had to code it twice
<br>but that's a story for the psfla blog! or the psfla tumblr!! putting it here would just seem off topic
<br>we should instead. uh. talk about what this blog post is titled after!
</w></p>

<h3><w>THIS.</w></h3>
<h2><w>GODDAMN.</w></h2>
<h1><w>THING.</w></h1>

<p><w>i recently got a quest 2!
<br>its awesome! but it also sucks!! a lot!!!!
</w></p>

<p><w>my first experence with vr was with like. those plastic things that you put your phone into. 
<br>i thought vr Just sucked... mainly because you could like. what. look at things for a while with your face to activate them
<br>it was cool tech, but having to slide your phone in each time you wanted to use vr, and the fact that i couldn't really use controllers in vr kinda just. made google cardboard suck.
</w></p>

<h3><w>BUT THE QUEST HAS CONTROLLERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</w></h3>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qUrRZcF.jpeg" class="smallpic"></p>

<p><w>they're genuinely the most comfortable controlers i've used. ever. 
<br>i can perfectly wrap my hands around them and they just. feel so nice to hold. aaghhhh i'd probably just hold them for fun if i had nothing to do 
<br>they also run off of AA batteries!
</w></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rgPhZi0.jpeg" class="smallpic"></p>

<p><w>it's a really odd choice, concidering these were released in 2020... but hey! i've used this headset for like. maybe 8 hours? including youtube? and both controllers' charge only dropped by 10%... so that's nice
<br>you also only need to use one battery per controller!!! take THAT gameboy
</w></p>

<p><img src="/resc/img/legacy/gameboybatteries.jpg" class="smallpic" title="50% less batteries required! we've come a long way in the last 31 years"></p>

<p><w>when navigating menus in the headset, the controllers shoot out little dots that kinda remind me of the wii's pointers... it's really cool to be able to basically dual wield wii remotes when typing on a keyboard
<br>basically, the controllers are great. 10/10. i'd adopt them and raise them alongside <a style="cursor: pointer;" onclick="window.open('https://media1.tenor.com/m/ecGBThCj6z0AAAAC/car-garn47.gif', '_blank').focus()">car</a> if my <asdf title="girlfriend actually... i'm 15">wife</asdf> let me. the actual headset on the other hand....
</w></p>

<p><img src="/resc/img/legacy/midroll.png" class="smallpic">

<p><w>hi! welcome back!
<br>we're talking about the quest 2 :) 
<br>here's my headset:
</w></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3Pz0bli.jpeg" class="smallpic">

<p><w>my <asdf title="again, girlfriend, i'm 15">wife</asdf> made me buy some accessories for it. namely, a foam facial interface (that's what they call the thing that rests on your face, apparently :p), and a headstrap with a battery 
<br>all and all, this totaled out to around 250 dollars!
<br>the quest 3 by itself costs 500 dollars new right now!
<br>
<br> 500 dollars!
<br> i can't afford that
</w></p>

<p><w>actually using the headset is pretty fun... just being in a different reality is cool :3
<br> just watching youtube in my bedroom is cooler with the headset than on my phone! i don't have to look at my body
<br> i like that i don't have to look at my body in vr
<br>vrchat is also fun, mainly because you can see other people :3 it's easy to get overwelmed in public spaces though, seeing as it still feels a lot like you're in public...
<br>but you get to chose how you look! so it's still better than being out in public in the real world
</w></p>

<p><w>but... the fact that it hurts my eyes to use my headset, the fact that the pixels are visible to a point where it feels really weird to use, and the fact that my glasses poke into my face and make my face physically hurt when using the headset are the main things keeping me from living in vr
<br>and that's a good thing</w></p>

<p><w>vr is scarily addictive.
</w></p>
<p><w>
<br>i can see this technology getting better. i can see it getting more comfortable, and easier to use. i can see engineers figuring out a way to mitigate eye strain. i can see a world where putting on vr goggles feels the same as putting on glasses
<br>i can see a world where i won't want to leave vr
<br>
<br>i can see a world where i become complacent with the heightened reality headsets provide
<br>
<br>i don't like where we're going
</w></p>

<p><w>i don't like where we're going with ai, with social media, with everything tech-related designed to keep us from actually using our tech
<br>i don't like that everything tech-related is trending to become something that keeps us from using our brains
</w></p>

<br>
<p><w>i guess this is why i have a neocities page
</w></p>
<br>
<p><w>i guess this is why i don't have windows 11 installed
</w></p>
<br>
<p><w>i guess this is why i try to stray away from "big tech", even though it becomes harder and harder to seperate yourself from it each day
</w></p>
<br><br><br>
<p><w>i guess this is why i use firefox
