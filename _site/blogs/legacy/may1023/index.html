<p><w> well uh. hi
<br>ive been inclined to write another one of these things !! half because im still forever out of ideas, half because i like. just cant work on my website right now. even though i want to
<br>so!!!! im just writing another blog post... aha
<br>i have like. a few things to talk about... first thing is that!! i have become a homestuck
<br>yipperydoodles i know what an alteria and a beforus is thats so insane im so cool totally i have unearthed something that no one else as uncovered before Anyways
<br>crocs. those green shoes
<br><img src=/resc/img/legacy/crocs.jpeg class=smallpic>
<br>those things. i have a pair now
<br>theyre actually neon green... but they were the only green they had so :P 
<br>apparently some people think theyre comfy??? i mean they are made out of foam
<br>
<br> but they have SPIKES 
<br><img src=/resc/img/legacy/OW.png class=smallpic>
<br> seriously they hurt. :( 
<br> im sure it hurts less once youve gotten used to how they feel but!!! i just got mine yesterday theyre still like. the soles are still not super dirty
<br> also they make your feet stink... i can vaguely smell rotten cabbage from my Repugnant Appendages aka my feet
<br> so?? why am i wearing crocs ??????
<br> its becauwse apparently ive been abusing my toe :( i dont think itd be ungross to say more than that
<br> ALSO - i went on crocs.com because it was on my shoe right
<br> well!! apparently ruffle likes to think that crocs.com is a flash site
<br> so my browser just showed a blank page when i went to the website...
<br> i used inspect element to see if the page was actually empty, and then i saw a ruffle thing?? so i turned off ruffle for a bit and then. the site worked! aha
<br>anyways, javascript!!1! ive gotten slightly better at it
<br> mainly because i know what a function is now. i can finally make a game if i feel so inclined to do so ^_^
<br> anddd i have nothing else to talk about!! i mean
<br> this might be the first cross platform blog thing i post. if im not lazy
<br> i dont count on myself to not be lazy, but i also dont count her to be lazy either!! shrodinger’s lazy
<br> anyways yeah byebye 
<br> have a good!!! whatever your having!!!!
