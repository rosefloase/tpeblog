<!-- AUGHH MURDER DEATH KILLING OH MY GOD
new tpe blogpost!
oh we are actually all holding hands everything is perfect :D -->
i may or may not have been neglecting this website for. more than a few reasons
<br>such reasons include...
<br><br> - neocities being banned at my school for some reason???
<br> - bloodbound and general php practice 
<br> - wii u garbage
</w></p>

<h3><w>the neocities school situation thing</w></h3>
<p><w>in the past, i've primarily written content for my website at school... due to all the downtime i'd have. unfortunately, neocities was just. blocked by the router at school?? and since the school enforces chromebook usage, i can't even set up any files locally
<br>i've tried to email the head of IT, but she's usually busy... i emailed her a month ago and she still hasn't responded. trying not to be cynical about it
<br>this, along with other things eating into my free time, has put tpe in a bit of a content drought... i'll try to work on it more consistently, but with my Strange Brain i can't promise anything :(
</w></p>

<h3><w>bloodbound</w></h3>
<p><w>"what is bloodbound????" bloodbound is a msp(fan)a that i'm working on with a <a href=https://scalarvectormatrixtensor.neocities.org/ target=_blank>friend</a> of mine! it's currently in a development stage, but i've been the main artist so far :p
<br>bloodbound is also a kind of testing ground for php. instead of having to update the html of each page individually, i just have to make a new entry in my php database, upload a few asset files, and bam! new page! 
<br>originally, i worked on the web design in only html/css/js... no php. this proved to be horrible when i wanted to implement something like a go back button! i'd have to update the (at the time) 40~ webpages individually once i got the css finalized :( this drove me away from the project for a while... until one day i randomly decided "man i should learn php" because i heard that mspa used it, and that it could really help with developing something like this. i then whipped up a proof of concept mspa-like thing locally with xampp, just to see if it was even possible for me to do it... which it was! once i finished it, i explored hosting options  
<br>initially, i tried hosting with a2. this... didn't really suit my needs! i wasn't able to find the htdocs folder, and good god it was expensive. sure, it was like 12 dollars a month... but you had to pay that upfront. paying over 100 dollars a year for something i wouldn't use the full potential for didn't really sound like a good deal?
<br>after this i tried looking at more options... but after a2 burnt me, i was scared off by hostinger being paid only. i then looked up "php hosting free" and found infinitlyfree! yes it's spelled wrong
<br><br><img src=/resc/img/legacy/dumbass.png class="smallpic"><br>
<br>i then set up the mspa test on the server easily enough, and started work on php-ifying bloodbound :p
<br>as it stands, the current page for loading bloodbound story pages (eg, something like <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/newindex.php?s=6&p=001903" target=_blank>this</a>) takes up 237 lines of code... i also implemented a new news system that only requires the writer to fill out some xml tags! though, due to the fact neocities doesn't support php or mysql databases, i can't set it up on my personal website... blegh
</w></p>

<h3><w>i love my wii u :3</w></h3>
<p><w>so! have you heard of this thing called riitag?
