<p><w>hi! did you know that i've had more SCHOOL WORK and thus less TIME to work on MY WEBSITE? well! if you didn't, that's a fact you now know!
<br>i still have <i>some</i> time on my hands to create things though, even if it is lessened... so you wanna know what i've done?</w></p>
    <h2><w>a partial rewrite of the xDx3xP track page, a webpage dedicated to godot devlogs, and an mspadventure-viewing webpage to get myself accustomed to json files!</w></h2>
<small>let's start with the mspa thing, as it was the first thing i did in this list :p</small>

    <h3><w>mspas, now viewable with javascript!</w></h3>
<p><w>after learning that you can detect url GET data (like the ?v= in youtube's webpages) with javascript thanks to a <a href=https://acdsstuck.neocities.org/ target=_blank>mspa hosted on neocities</a>, i felt like i had an obligation to recreate my previously bloated php-based mspa viewer in a format that neocities would let me host on their servers! and thus, the proof-of concept <a href=https://thepersonever.net/tests/mspa/ target=_parent>psfla</a> was born.
  <br>through my experience with bloodbound, i knew having a simple database with html <strong><em>TAGS</em></strong> stored within would be the best way to create a modular adventure. with bloodbound, i initially had only a field that could be a link to whichever image would need to be displayed... which proved to be a problem when i needed to show video files with movieclips, or when creating flashes with interactivity :( so i came up with this weirdass solution that was just</w></p>
    <img src=/resc/img/legacy/uhoh.png style="width: 500px">
    <p><w>yeah that was a bad idea
    <br>luckily, with the creation of this new system i was able to rectify that! instead of needing to make thousands of "pagetypes", i'm now able to just list any tag to be inserted :D</w></p>
    <img src=/resc/img/legacy/imagestring.png style="width: 500px">
    <img src=/resc/img/legacy/imagefunc.png style="width: 500px">
    <p><w>creating this viewer lead me into the world of json. with this project under my belt, i then had an idea for my next project!</w></p>
    
    <h3><w>godot devlogging</w></h3>
    
    <p><w>since i wanted to do more with this new information, and because i had started to develop with godot recently, i decided to set up a webpage for my godot devlog!
    <br>it took a little longer, but i managed to fit the code to automatically add new links to logs and the function to parse the json into readable code into under 60 lines of source code! that's a new best for anything complicated at all for me</w></p>
    <img src=/resc/img/legacy/500.png style="width: 500px">
    <small style="display: block;">ah yes i love 500% firefox</small>
    
    <p><w>finally, after all this, i realized there's not really any great way to share a specific song from this website... so, i decided to add that functionality to xdx3xp's track page! unfortunatly, due to not wanting to just put "uhhh yeah run whatever function is in the url what could go wrong" in the tracklist's javascript, this happened:</w></p>
    <img src=/resc/img/legacy/elseif.png style="width: 500px">
    <p><w>yeah. kinda a sucky way of doing things. so i did what any normal person would do, and completly rewrote the back-end of the script to use json files instead of several functions with differing strings!</w></p>
    <img src=/resc/img/legacy/yeah.png style="width: 500px">
    <p><w>the script now takes up half of the space that it did before :D win for all of those who are UTTERLY STUPID!
    <br>
    <br>that's all i have for now. goodbye FOREVER!!!!!</w></p>
