<p><w>it's 3 am as im writing this. dont judge me. 
<br>have you been wondering where i've been this past month, despite silently telling myself i would work on my site every weekday? well have you met the STEAM WINTER SALE
<br><img src=/resc/img/legacy/hollowsale.png class="smallpic">
<br>yeah i bought this like. at the start of winter break. and ive played it for 35 hours and just got to 100% (i know it goes higher than that :p)
<br>hollow knight is a very nice bug game with GOOD ANIMATION, nice gameplay, lots of things to do, and bugs that wont creep you out! except for flukemons! disgusting vermen they are 
<br>it's also not that easy easy but you can still get good at it :D im not that great though i'm currently trying to beat the last boss and OUGH
<br>if you wanna play it you can find it <a href=https://www.hollowknight.com/ target=_new>here</a>... it's very fun you should try it 
<br>i may or may not have bought this out of impulse because my internet sibling directed me to a MossBag (you're welcome &lt;3) video haha
<br>on the topic of new games... i think this shouldn't need to be said but i only found out how much more fun games are if you play them blind? like two years ago recent
<br>instead of being like "oh holy shit im going to watch every single halo video i can find before playing it" im like. oh right hollow kight exists... people like that game... i should try it maybe if it's not 15 dollars... 
<br>my mind has been slow cooking in an oven for multiple days. i have done nothing but stay up all night talk to queer Platonic partner and play hollow knight
<br>uh i also tried new vegas but dear god i am way too soft for that game :( maybe when i want to burn people alive i'll play it again
<br>
<br>do you want me to talk about my presents :)
<br>
<br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QXSCmhF.jpg class="smallpic">
<br>for the presents of parents i got from my parents... i got an rtx 1060, a new psu, some silly insane bootleg pikmin plushies, and candy !!!!
<br>
<br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/K9BlrHF.jpg class="smallpic">
<br>for the presents i got from my extended family... i got super mario wonder and the pikmin switch ports from my grandparents, the SAME SET OF PIKMIN BOOTLEGS???? from my uncle (i love that i got two it's so funny thank you :D) and the harl whiteboard and the problem sleuth poster from my aunt!!! 
<br>
<br>i haven't been able to set up my new graphics card yet... the psu i got with it doesn't have the right power connector for my cpu :( and i can't use two power supplies in unison... the one with connection to the cpu will be the only one that actually powers anything :p 
<br>i have. things to say about the pikmin 1 port. i'll leave it at that and make pages for it when i have more time to play each game through on the switch... i might just end up buying a faster sd card so i can get cfw running at a faster speed, then emulate the gamecube versions there honestly 
<br>
<br>bye?
