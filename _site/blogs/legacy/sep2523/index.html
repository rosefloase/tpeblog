<p><w> so!!! its been like a month 
<br>uh... in terms of the new computer, ive basically replaced all of the parts in it except for the psu, front i/o port, and rear fan
<br>though the psu might be coming out soon... i want to upgrade from a quadro k2200 to a gtx 1060... but it needs a 6-pin power out to be powered. and my oem lenovo psu absolutely does not have that 
<br>pikmin 4 has been beaten multiple times now! its a good game but i dont think its my favorite pikmin game :( 
<br>i have read through pesterquest! im scared about the epilogues but. im slightly curious about them now... still mostly scared
<br>twitter is still hell thank you for asking
<br>uh... oh yeah my website ive worked on that a bit
<br>i have worked though a lot of the games collection now!!! theres still a long way to go, but ive gotten through the bulk of my systems
<br>through an exercise of javascript i have made my own media controller!!! you can use it on xdx3xp's <a href=https://thepersonever.net/room//xdx3xp/tracks target=_parent>tracks page</a> :3
<br>i also bought neocities supporter so i can download my site each month again :) you can check out the archives <a href=https://roseycatttttt.github.io/tperesources/backup target=_blank>here!!</a>
<br>the <a href=https://thepersonever-site-updates.tumblr.com/ target=_blank>update blog</a> is still running btw!!! you should go follow it!!! please
<br>i think i might be deprecating the rss feed now... i dont think anyone is really using it :P 
<br>sorry to the one person who has my blog in their rss feed
