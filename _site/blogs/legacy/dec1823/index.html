<p><w>hi everyone i killed multiple geese on my way here :D
<br>new years is almost here... but i kinda don't care? it's just the changing of dates :p 
<br>over the past month, i finished up pikmin 2's caves which you can find <a href=https://thepersonever.net/pikmin/pikmin2 target=_blank>here</a> :3 making the actual pages didn't take very long (after i got the buttons coded correctly), but getting the assets really limited what i could do each day :p i'm not able to memorize everything from each individual sublevel, and i can't get screenshots on just a chromebook... nor can i pay attention to audio. so, i got all of the assets and notes needed for each webpage and sublevel at home, and actually implemented everything during downtime at school!
<br>i also finished the preplaning for an animation which you can see <a href=https://thepersonever.net/flashes/pikitorytest target=_blank>here</a>!!! it doesn't work properly on mobile... but at least it works with all the actual computers that i've tested it on! there's some flashing lights in it though, so epileptics be warned :(
<br>other than that, i got a new album!!! :D it's "goodbye, my 4-track" by logan whitewurst. logan whitedog
<br>i also got a few new games! little big planet on ps3, and sonic 06 on the 360. i haven't really gotten through a lot of either of them, but sonic 06 is a lot less glitchy than i thought it would be. don't get me wrong, there's a <i>lot</i> of glitches, but... its not unplayable? i'd say its just a little more buggy than sa1 was on the dreamcast
<br>*yawn*... i hope i get 17 dollars for christmas...
